# Let's write some unit tests

So far we've not written a lot of code but its still a good idea to get into the habit of writing
unit tests.  Spring Boot 1.4 provides some new testing capabilities that we want to take advantage
of.

First, lets create a test for our PatientRepository.  In the test section, create a package called
`repositories` and then add a Java class called `PatientRepositoryTests`.  In that class add the
following code:

```java
@RunWith(SpringRunner.class)
@DataJpaTest
public class PatientRepositoryTests {

    @Autowired
    private TestEntityManager entityManager;

    @Autowired
    PatientRepository patientRepository;

    @Test
    public void test_PatientRepository_FindById_ExpectExists() throws Exception {
        Long patientId = entityManager.persistAndGetId(new Patient(), Long.class);
        Patient aPatient = patientRepository.findById(patientId).orElseThrow(NotFoundException::new);
        assertThat(aPatient.getId()).isEqualTo(patientId);
    }
}
```

Run the test and review the logs.  You should see several SQL statements
being executed by the JPA provider.  In this case we see the PATIENT table
CREATE, INSERT, SELECT and finally DROP.

Specifically with the INSERT and SELECT statements, is this similar to
what you might have written by hand?

Spoiler Alert!  I expect that this test case will fail at some point in
the future.  Can you guess why?

Now let's add a test for the Controller.  Create a package called
`controllers` and create a test class called `PatientControllerTests`.
Then add the following code:

```java
@RunWith(SpringRunner.class)
@WebMvcTest(PatientController.class)
public class PatientControllerTests {
    @Autowired
    private MockMvc mockMvc;

    @MockBean
    private PatientRepository mockPatientRepository;

    @Test
    public void test_MockPatient_Expect_ThatGuy() throws Exception {
        given(mockPatientRepository.findById(1L)).willReturn(Optional.of(thatGuy()));

        mockMvc.perform(get("/patients/1")
                .accept(APPLICATION_JSON_UTF8))
                .andExpect(status().isOk())
                .andExpect(content().contentType(APPLICATION_JSON_UTF8))
                .andExpect(jsonPath("$.givenName", is("Guy")))
                .andExpect(jsonPath("$.familyName", is("Stromboli")))
                .andExpect(jsonPath("$.birthDate", is("1942-11-21")));
    }

    private Patient thatGuy() {
        Patient aPatient = new Patient();
        aPatient.setGivenName("Guy");
        aPatient.setFamilyName("Stromboli");
        aPatient.setBirthDate(LocalDate.of(1942, 11, 21));
        return aPatient;
    }
}
```

This is a "mock" test.  It is not testing the repository that we created
but instead is leveraging a mock version of it thanks to Mockito.

Basically, all we are doing is telling the mock how to behave when we
call it and then are asserting that it is responding correctly.  It is a
good test but it isn't really a complete test end-to-end test.  The
overall benefit of this kind of test is when you want to test certain
behaviors that might be hard to recreate under normal circumstances.

Next, lets add a more complete web test.  In the same package, add a
test class called `PatientControllerWebTests`.  Then add the following
code:

```java
@RunWith(SpringRunner.class)
@SpringBootTest(webEnvironment=RANDOM_PORT)
public class PatientControllerWebTests {

    @Autowired
    private TestRestTemplate restTemplate;

    @Test
    public void test_PatientController_getPatient_Expect_Patient1_Exists() throws Exception {
        ResponseEntity<Patient> entity = restTemplate.getForEntity("/patients/1", Patient.class);

        assertThat(entity.getStatusCode()).isEqualTo(HttpStatus.OK);
        assertThat(entity.getBody()).isNotNull()
                .hasFieldOrPropertyWithValue("givenName", "Phillip")
                .hasFieldOrPropertyWithValue("familyName", "Spec")
                .hasFieldOrPropertyWithValue("birthDate", LocalDate.of(1972, 5, 5));
    }

    @Test
    public void test_PatientController_getPatient_Expect_Patient99999999_NotFound() throws Exception {
        ResponseEntity<Patient> entity = restTemplate.getForEntity("/patients/99999999", Patient.class);
        assertThat(entity.getStatusCode()).isEqualTo(HttpStatus.NOT_FOUND);
    }

    @Test
    public void test_PatientController_getPatient_Expect_Invalid() throws Exception {
        String response = restTemplate.getForObject("/patients/foo", String.class);
        assertThat(response).contains("Bad Request");
    }
}
```

If you run this test right now, it will fail.  Why?
  
Well, the obvious answer is that when we ran the test and the database
is initialized with empty data.  How do we initialize the database so we
can rely on a specific data set?

One way is to tap into a feature of Spring Boot.  If we create a file
in the test section of the project called `resources` and then a file
called `data.sql` within it we have a way to initialize the database on
ever test case.

Create that file and add the following to it:

```sql
INSERT INTO PATIENT(id, given_name, family_name, birth_date) VALUES (null, 'Phillip', 'Spec', '1972-5-5');
INSERT INTO PATIENT(id, given_name, family_name, birth_date) VALUES (null, 'Sally', 'Certify', '1973-6-6');
```

During the startup of the tests, Spring Boot will invoke this file and
initialize the database.  Now, if we re-run the test cases, they should
succeed with a green bar!

Yeah!

# What about performance?

TODO setup a performance test.
https://github.com/jmeter-maven-plugin/jmeter-maven-plugin
http://www.xoriant.com/blog/software-testing-and-qa/performance-testing-of-restful-apis-using-jmeter.html

TODO I've add an initial performance plan but this will need to be
better documented as JMeter can be a complex tool in and of itself.
Additionally, I'm still working out details on how to load the in-memory
database using a CSV so I can share the data between the application and
the JMeter test (what I have appears to work but I'm still looking for
better that having to store the CSV in the resources/classpath).

After this, it might be a good idea to go back and refactor this to be
the pattern used from the start.

FYI - The reason I'm wanting to have JMeter set up so early in the life
of the project is so that we can establish base-lines for later as we
add more complex capabilities.  I think its a good idea to have some
sense of what impact to performance a specific feature can have.

Another piece to document would be to connect to the application with
JConsole and then run the test.  Reviewing heap and threads is a good
practice.

Finally, consider introducing the jmeter plugin to the maven POM.

# Bean Validation JSR 309/3

There a a few types of validations that we can add to our application
for the entity classes.
  
One type is to use the JPA `@Column` annotations to define constraints
on the resulting database tables.  I typically like to delay this
exercise until the project is a bit more fleshed out.  During this
initial discovery phase, I find it more advantageous to leave the schema
more flexible and adaptable.  At some point in the future I plan on
having the schema be versioned - then we'll need to investigate
additional tooling like Flyway or Liquibase.

Another option for data validation is the Java Bean Validator
annotations:
https://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/stable/validator/reference/en-US/html_single/#table-spec-constraints

In the domain object for Patient, lets add a few common sense
validations:

```java
    @NotBlank @Size(min = 2)
    private String givenName;
    @NotBlank @Size(min = 2)
    private String familyName;
```

If you restart the application and look at the Hibernate create table,
you'll see that I was wrong.  Hibernate did honor these validations and
modified the schema accordingly.  Now if I try to post a blank JSON
object to the /patients URL, I should see an error:

```json
{
  "timestamp": "2016-12-14T15:22:39.519+0000",
  "status": 500,
  "error": "Internal Server Error",
  "exception": "javax.validation.ConstraintViolationException",
  "message": "Validation failed for classes [com.undertree.symptom.domain.Patient] during persist time for groups [javax.validation.groups.Default, ]\nList of constraint violations:[\n\tConstraintViolationImpl{interpolatedMessage='may not be null', propertyPath=givenName, rootBeanClass=class com.undertree.symptom.domain.Patient, messageTemplate='{javax.validation.constraints.NotNull.message}'}\n\tConstraintViolationImpl{interpolatedMessage='may not be null', propertyPath=familyName, rootBeanClass=class com.undertree.symptom.domain.Patient, messageTemplate='{javax.validation.constraints.NotNull.message}'}\n]",
  "path": "/patients"
}
```

During persistence I violated one or more constraints and the database
isn't happy.  I'm not happy either because of the 500 error status code.
I'd actually like to catch this condition higher up the stack and return
a more proper error.

Java and Spring have a simple solution for this.  Add a `@Valid`
annotation to the RequestBody parameter like this:

```java
    @PostMapping("/patients")
    public Patient addPatient(@Valid @RequestBody Patient patient) {
        return patientRepository.save(patient);
    }
```

Restart and rerun the POST:

```json
{
  "timestamp": "2016-12-14T15:41:20.115+0000",
  "status": 400,
  "error": "Bad Request",
  "exception": "org.springframework.web.bind.MethodArgumentNotValidException",
  "errors": [
    {
      "codes": [
        "NotNull.patient.givenName",
        "NotNull.givenName",
        "NotNull.java.lang.String",
        "NotNull"
      ],
      "arguments": [
        {
          "codes": [
            "patient.givenName",
            "givenName"
          ],
          "arguments": null,
          "defaultMessage": "givenName",
          "code": "givenName"
        }
      ],
      "defaultMessage": "may not be null",
      "objectName": "patient",
      "field": "givenName",
      "rejectedValue": null,
      "bindingFailure": false,
      "code": "NotNull"
    },
    {
      "codes": [
        "NotNull.patient.familyName",
        "NotNull.familyName",
        "NotNull.java.lang.String",
        "NotNull"
      ],
      "arguments": [
        {
          "codes": [
            "patient.familyName",
            "familyName"
          ],
          "arguments": null,
          "defaultMessage": "familyName",
          "code": "familyName"
        }
      ],
      "defaultMessage": "may not be null",
      "objectName": "patient",
      "field": "familyName",
      "rejectedValue": null,
      "bindingFailure": false,
      "code": "NotNull"
    }
  ],
  "message": "Validation failed for object='patient'. Error count: 2",
  "path": "/patients"
}
```

It 400 error is more in lines with what I was expecting but wow that is
a verbose error.

TODO this would be a good place to look into customizing the Spring Boot
standard error object.  The errors block is just blindly marshalling the
entire object with codes and arguments that aren't all that useful to a
client.  We could probably clean this up a bit.

I did waste some time trying to customized the ValidationMessages and
had a little success but it didn't feel as clean as I would have liked
so I need to do more research there as well.

TODO: refer to http://www.bbenson.co/post/spring-validations-with-examples/
Thanks Josh!

# More Unit Tests

Lets run or test cases just to be sure everything is working as
expected.  Wait, there was an error:

```
javax.validation.ConstraintViolationException: Validation failed for classes [com.undertree.symptom.domain.Patient] during persist time for groups [javax.validation.groups.Default, ]
List of constraint violations:[
	ConstraintViolationImpl{interpolatedMessage='may not be empty', propertyPath=familyName, rootBeanClass=class com.undertree.symptom.domain.Patient, messageTemplate='{org.hibernate.validator.constraints.NotBlank.message}'}
	ConstraintViolationImpl{interpolatedMessage='may not be empty', propertyPath=givenName, rootBeanClass=class com.undertree.symptom.domain.Patient, messageTemplate='{org.hibernate.validator.constraints.NotBlank.message}'}
]
```

This is what I thought might happen.  Our original test was using an
empty resource during the Add.  Now this is an invalid state.  We should
fix that first.

First add a new library to our dependencies in the pom.xml:

```xml
		<dependency>
			<groupId>org.apache.commons</groupId>
			<artifactId>commons-lang3</artifactId>
			<version>3.5</version>
		</dependency>
```

We'll use this in conjunction with a helpful utility class that can be
added to test suite under a new `domain` package.  This will be a new
Java class called `TestPatientBuilder` with the code:

```java
public class TestPatientBuilder {
    private final Patient testPatient = new Patient();

    public TestPatientBuilder() {
        // Start out with a valid randomized patient
        testPatient.setGivenName(RandomStringUtils.randomAlphabetic(2, 30));
        testPatient.setFamilyName(RandomStringUtils.randomAlphabetic(2, 30));
        LocalDate start = LocalDate.of(1949, Month.JANUARY, 1);
        long days = ChronoUnit.DAYS.between(start, LocalDate.now());
        testPatient.setBirthDate(start.plusDays(RandomUtils.nextLong(0, days + 1)));
    }

    public TestPatientBuilder withGivenName(String givenName) {
        testPatient.setGivenName(givenName);
        return this;
    }

    public TestPatientBuilder withFamilyName(String familyName) {
        testPatient.setFamilyName(familyName);
        return this;
    }

    public TestPatientBuilder withBirthDate(LocalDate birthDate) {
        testPatient.setBirthDate(birthDate);
        return this;
    }

    public Patient build() {
        return testPatient;
    }
}
```

This class lets us create random test patients with the added ability to
override any attribute that we would like.  This can be very useful in
unit testing.

Now, try it out buy updating the failing test case:

```java
   @Test
    public void test_PatientRepository_FindById_ExpectExists() throws Exception {
        Long patientId = entityManager.persistAndGetId(new TestPatientBuilder().build(), Long.class);
        Patient aPatient = patientRepository.findById(patientId).orElseThrow(NotFoundException::new);
        assertThat(aPatient.getId()).isEqualTo(patientId);
    }
```

We should go ahead and add a few negative tests that certify the
validations that we recently added.  First add a JUnit rule for
exceptions:

```java
    @Rule
    public ExpectedException thrown = ExpectedException.none();
```

Now when we expect an exception to be thrown we'll set up the `thrown`
with our expectations:

```java
    @Test
    public void test_PatientRepository_SaveWithNull_ExpectException() throws Exception {
        thrown.expect(InvalidDataAccessApiUsageException.class);
        patientRepository.save((Patient)null);
    }

    @Test
    public void test_PatientRepository_SaveWithEmpty_ExpectException() throws Exception {
        thrown.expect(ConstraintViolationException.class);
        thrown.expectMessage(containsString("'may not be empty'"));
        patientRepository.save(new Patient());
    }

    @Test
    public void test_PatientRepository_SaveWithEmptyGivenName_ExpectException() throws Exception {
        thrown.expect(ConstraintViolationException.class);
        thrown.expectMessage(allOf(containsString("givenName"), containsString("'may not be empty'")));
        patientRepository.save(new TestPatientBuilder().withGivenName("").build());
    }

    @Test
    public void test_PatientRepository_SaveWithEmptyFamilyName_ExpectException() throws Exception {
        thrown.expect(ConstraintViolationException.class);
        thrown.expectMessage(allOf(containsString("familyName"), containsString("'may not be empty'")));
        patientRepository.save(new TestPatientBuilder().withFamilyName("").build());
    }

    @Test
    public void test_PatientRepository_SaveWithShortGivenName_ExpectException() throws Exception {
        thrown.expect(ConstraintViolationException.class);
        thrown.expectMessage(allOf(containsString("givenName"), containsString("'size must be between 2 and")));
        patientRepository.save(new TestPatientBuilder().withGivenName("A").build());
    }

    @Test
    public void test_PatientRepository_SaveWithShortFamilyName_ExpectException() throws Exception {
        thrown.expect(ConstraintViolationException.class);
        thrown.expectMessage(allOf(containsString("familyName"), containsString("'size must be between 2 and")));
        patientRepository.save(new TestPatientBuilder().withFamilyName("Z").build());
    }
```

Not only can we assert that a specific exception is thrown but we can
verify that it contains the message details that we would expect.

Finally, lets refactor and update the Controller tests.  In the
`PatientControllerTests` refactor to use the `TestPatientBuilder`:

```java
        given(mockPatientRepository.findById(1L))
                .willReturn(Optional.of(new TestPatientBuilder()
                        .withGivenName("Guy")
                        .withFamilyName("Stromboli")
                        .withBirthDate(LocalDate.of(1942, 11, 21))
                        .build()));
```

In the `PatientControllerWebTests` add a few new tests that also verify
the `@Valid` is working:

```java
    @Test
    public void test_PatientController_addPatient_Expect_OK() throws Exception {
        ResponseEntity<Patient> entity = restTemplate.postForEntity("/patients",
                new TestPatientBuilder().build(), Patient.class);

        assertThat(entity.getStatusCode()).isEqualTo(HttpStatus.OK);
        assertThat(entity.getBody()).isNotNull()
                .hasNoNullFieldsOrProperties();
    }

    @Test
    public void test_PatientController_addPatient_WithEmpty_Expect_BadRequest() throws Exception {
        ResponseEntity<String> json = restTemplate.postForEntity("/patients", new Patient(), String.class);

        assertThat(json.getStatusCode()).isEqualTo(HttpStatus.BAD_REQUEST);
        JSONAssert.assertEquals("{exception:\"org.springframework.web.bind.MethodArgumentNotValidException\"}", json.getBody(), false);
    }

    @Test
    public void test_PatientController_addPatient_WithEmptyGivenName_Expect_BadRequest() throws Exception {
        ResponseEntity<String> json = restTemplate.postForEntity("/patients",
                new TestPatientBuilder().withGivenName("").build(), String.class);

        assertThat(json.getStatusCode()).isEqualTo(HttpStatus.BAD_REQUEST);
        JSONAssert.assertEquals("{exception:\"org.springframework.web.bind.MethodArgumentNotValidException\"}", json.getBody(), false);
    }

    @Test
    public void test_PatientController_addPatient_WithEmptyFamilyName_Expect_BadRequest() throws Exception {
        ResponseEntity<String> json = restTemplate.postForEntity("/patients",
                new TestPatientBuilder().withFamilyName("").build(), String.class);

        assertThat(json.getStatusCode()).isEqualTo(HttpStatus.BAD_REQUEST);
        JSONAssert.assertEquals("{exception:\"org.springframework.web.bind.MethodArgumentNotValidException\"}", json.getBody(), false);
    }
```

# More Attributions

The patient needs some more attribution.  Let's add a few new fields that will help round out the `Patient`:

```java
    private String additionalName;
    @Transient
    private Integer age;
    @Email
    private String email;
    @Min(0)
    private Short height; // height in cm
    @Min(0)
    private Short weight; // weight in kg
```

The `additionalName` is useful for capturing a person's middle but what is the @Transient annotation on `age`?  Well
this is a derived attribute based on `birthDate`.  Since it is derived, we don't want JPA to persist it so this
annotation is useful for signifying that (its basically an ignore marker).  However, since we don't have any storage
mechanism for this how will it get set?

I've chosen to calculate the Patient's age each time `birthDate` is set.  Like this:

```java
    public void setBirthDate(LocalDate birthDate) {
        this.birthDate = birthDate;
        this.age = birthDate == null ? null : Period.between(birthDate, LocalDate.now()).getYears();
    }
```

This ensures that any time the birthDate is modified the age is recalculated.  However, if you run the program right now
age will always appear null.  That is a bit of a surprise.  It is because Hibernate is using Field level access based on
how we've used the JPA annotations.  There is a simple way to update the birthDate field so Hibernate will instead use
Property-level access:

```java
    @Access(AccessType.PROPERTY)
    private LocalDate birthDate;
```

Now Hibernate will use the getter/setter methods when accessing birthDate and age will get set appropriately.

In addition add the associated getter and setter for the new properties and restart the application.  Note: since age is
not stored we don't want anyone to accidentally change it.  An easy way to ensure this is to not provide a setter method
for it.

Our new properties are being returned as null in the response JSON.  If we don't want Jackson to marshal null values,
there is a quick setting that we can change in the `application.properties`:

```properties
spring.jackson.default-property-inclusion=non_null
```

That looks better.  If we want, we can go ahead and update the patients.csv to support these new fields:

```csv
ID,BIRTH_DATE,GIVEN_NAME,FAMILY_NAME,ADDITIONAL_NAME,GENDER,EMAIL,HEIGHT,WEIGHT
1,1972-05-05,Phillip,Spec,J,1,pjspec@junit.org,84,180
2,1973-06-06,Sally,Certify,T,2,,78,163
3,1962-02-15,Frank,Neubus,,0,,88,178
```

Then update the associate `data.sql`:

```sql
INSERT INTO PATIENT(ID,BIRTH_DATE,GIVEN_NAME,FAMILY_NAME,ADDITIONAL_NAME,GENDER,EMAIL,HEIGHT,WEIGHT)
  (SELECT * FROM CSVREAD(patients-bin.csv));
```

We also need to look at our test cases but first, lets update the `TestPatientBuilder` to account for the new
attributes:

```java
        testPatient.setEmail(String.format("%s@%s.com", RandomStringUtils.randomAlphanumeric(20),
                RandomStringUtils.randomAlphanumeric(20)));
        testPatient.setGender(Gender.values()[RandomUtils.nextInt(0, Gender.values().length)]);
        testPatient.setHeight((short) RandomUtils.nextInt(140, 300));
        testPatient.setWeight((short) RandomUtils.nextInt(50, 90));
```

Don't forget to add the associate "with" methods so we can override the random values if needed.

```java
    public TestPatientBuilder withAdditionalName(String additionalName) {
        testPatient.setAdditionalName(additionalName);
        return this;
    }

    public TestPatientBuilder withEmail(String email) {
        testPatient.setEmail(email);
        return this;
    }

    public TestPatientBuilder withGender(Gender gender) {
        testPatient.setGender(gender);
        return this;
    }

    public TestPatientBuilder withHeight(Short height) {
        testPatient.setHeight(height);
        return this;
    }

    public TestPatientBuilder withWeight(Short weight) {
        testPatient.setWeight(weight);
        return this;
    }
```

With the builder in place add some additional tests to the PatientRepositoryTests to exercise some of the new
constraints:

```java
    @Test
    public void test_PatientRepository_SaveWithInvalidEmail_ExpectException() throws Exception {
        thrown.expect(ConstraintViolationException.class);
        thrown.expectMessage(allOf(containsString("email"), containsString("'not a well-formed email address'")));
        patientRepository.save(new TestPatientBuilder().withEmail("baz").build());
    }

    @Test
    public void test_PatientRepository_SaveWithLessThanMinHeight_ExpectException() throws Exception {
        thrown.expect(ConstraintViolationException.class);
        thrown.expectMessage(allOf(containsString("height"), containsString("'must be greater than or equal to 0'")));
        patientRepository.save(new TestPatientBuilder().withHeight((short) -1).build());
    }

    @Test
    public void test_PatientRepository_SaveWithLessThanMinWeight_ExpectException() throws Exception {
        thrown.expect(ConstraintViolationException.class);
        thrown.expectMessage(allOf(containsString("weight"), containsString("'must be greater than or equal to 0'")));
        patientRepository.save(new TestPatientBuilder().withWeight((short) -1).build());
    }
```

Add a few more tests to the PatientControllerWebTests class:

```java
    @Test

        assertThat(json.getStatusCode()).isEqualTo(HttpStatus.BAD_REQUEST);

        assertThat(entity.getBody()).isNotNull()
                .hasFieldOrPropertyWithValue("age", LocalDate.now().getYear() - 1980);
    }
```

# Add Remaining "CRUD" Operations to the Patient

So far we have the CR of CRUD implemented.  This seems like a good opportunity to add the remaining lifecycle
operations.  In the `PatientController` add the following code:

```java
    @PutMapping(Patient.RESOURCE_PATH + "/{id}")
    public Patient updatePatientIncludingNulls(@PathVariable("id") Long id, @Valid @RequestBody Patient patient) {
        Patient aPatient = patientRepository.findById(id)
                .orElseThrow(() ->
                        new NotFoundException(String.format("Resource %s/%d not found", Patient.RESOURCE_PATH, id)));
        // copy bean properties including nulls
        BeanUtils.copyProperties(patient, aPatient);
        return patientRepository.save(aPatient);
    }
```

Simply replace the existing resource with the one supplied in the RequestBody.  This implementation first attempts to
load the resource in question and then overlay it with the one provided (including null or missing fields).  The
resource should return the replaced entity at the same location (id).

Add the following to the `PatientControllerWebTests`:

```java
    @Test
    public void test_PatientController_updatePatient_WithValidRandom_Expect_OK() throws Exception {
        HttpEntity<Patient> patientToUpdate = new HttpEntity<>(new TestPatientBuilder().build());
        
        ResponseEntity<Patient> entity = restTemplate.exchange("/patients/{id}", HttpMethod.PUT,
                patientToUpdate, Patient.class, new HashMap<String, Object>() {{ put("id", 1L); }});

        assertThat(entity.getStatusCode()).isEqualTo(HttpStatus.OK);
        assertThat(entity.getBody()).isNotNull()
                .isEqualToIgnoringGivenFields(patientToUpdate.getBody(), "id");
    }
```

# Returning a Collection of Resources

So far all of our resource interactions are with single entities but we frequently want to retrieve collections of
resources.  Spring Data provides some basic ones for JPA by default, so lets see what that might look like in our
controller.

Add the following code to the PatientController:

```java
    @GetMapping(Patient.RESOURCES_PATH)
    public List<Patient> getPatients() {
        return patientRepository.findAll();
    }
```

If you hit the /patients resource you should see the default patients that we have automatically created with the
data.sql and CSV file.  The result is a raw collection of resources.  The result set is small so we can return the whole
collection with this call but in reality, most unbounded queries like this can cause performance issues if not
automatically bounded.

To add this capability we need to add support for paging.  Replace the previous method with this:

```java
    @GetMapping(Patient.RESOURCE_PATH)
    public List<Patient> getPatients(Pageable pageable) {
        Page<Patient> pagedResults = patientRepository.findAll(pageable);

        if (!pagedResults.hasContent()) {
            throw new NotFoundException(String.format("Resource %s not found", Patient.RESOURCE_PATH));
        }

        return pagedResults.getContent();
    }
```

Now request the collection with paging parameters via http:

```bash
http "localhost:8080/patients?size=1&page=1"
```

The result is now limited to the second result (just remember that page starts at zero).  Without a lot of effort we can
now support paging.  The default page size is 20 so if a user does not provide any paging parameters, we can be assured
that we won't accidentally allow unbounded queries to be returned.  You can customize this with the `@PageableDefault`
annotation but to do so globally isn't possible yet without overriding `WebMvcConfigurerAdapter` and adding a customized
`PageableHandlerMethodArgumentResolver`.

In addition to pagination, you also get sorting support:

```bash
http "localhost:8080/patients?sort=familyName"
```

The result should be sorted as it was requested.  You can also verify this by reviewing the SQL that is being executed
in the logs:

```sql
    select
        patient0_.id as id1_1_,
        patient0_.additional_name as addition2_1_,
        patient0_.birth_date as birth_da3_1_,
        patient0_.email as email4_1_,
        patient0_.family_name as family_n5_1_,
        patient0_.gender as gender6_1_,
        patient0_.given_name as given_na7_1_,
        patient0_.height as height8_1_,
        patient0_.weight as weight9_1_ 
    from
        patient patient0_ 
    order by
        patient0_.family_name asc limit ?
```

TODO: discuss using HTTP header for metadata versus a JSON envelope for paging info.  Research shows lots of examples
using a JSON wrapper but many write-up/guides say very explicitly not to do this arguing that HTTP itself is the
envelope and to use headers for this information.  Right now I am leaning towards headers knowing that this does impact
human readability slightly if you are just using a default browser for GET requests.

To add the pagination metadata to the result replace/add the following code:

```java
    @GetMapping(Patient.RESOURCE_PATH)
    public List<Patient> getPatients(@PageableDefault(size = 30) Pageable pageable, HttpServletResponse response) {
        Page<Patient> pagedResults = patientRepository.findAll(pageable);

        setMetadataResponseHeaders(response, pageable, pagedResults);

        if (!pagedResults.hasContent()) {
            throw new NotFoundException(String.format("Resource %s not found", Patient.RESOURCE_PATH));
        }

        return pagedResults.getContent();
    }

    private void setMetadataResponseHeaders(HttpServletResponse response, Pageable pageable, Page pagedResults) {
        // TODO look into additional meta fields like first and last
        response.setHeader("X-Meta-Pagination",
                String.format("page-number=%d,page-size=%d,total-elements=%d,total-pages=%d",
                        pageable.getPageNumber(), pageable.getPageSize(),
                        pagedResults.getTotalElements(), pagedResults.getTotalPages()));
    }
```

If we make a call to /patients now, we get back a pagination result metadata header:

```
X-Meta-Pagination: page-number=0,page-size=30,total-elements=3,total-pages=1
```

This is pretty useful and non-intrusive on the client.  There are probably a lot of other pieces of metadata that could
prove useful and we will explore them further over time.

# Change Response to not return "raw" ids

It can be argued that returning the raw database id isn't a good RESTful design (or secure).  We should probably
introduce a UUID instead and use that as the reference.  But first, lets replace the raw id with the path representation
of itself.  To do so is fairly simple; let's modify the Patient entity as such:

```java
    @JsonIgnore
    public Long getId() {
        return id;
    }

    public String getResourceId() {
        return RESOURCE_PATH + "/" + id;
    }
```

The `@JsonIgnore` will cause Jackson to ignore this attribute during marshalling and instead use our synthetic resource
path to the entity.  Our results will now look something like this:

```json
{
  "givenName": "Sally",
  "additionalName": "T",
  "familyName": "Certify",
  "birthDate": "1973-06-06",
  "age": 43,
  "gender": "female",
  "height": 78,
  "weight": 163,
  "resourceId": "/patients/2"
}
```

We could also choose to just ignore the id/resourceId entirely and use a Link header with "self" described but this
won't work quite as well for collection resources.

Side Note: I also update the JMeter script to run a Find All and rerun the scripts together.  After a few runs to warm
up the JVM we get pretty consistent sub millisecond responses.  So far it does not appear that we have had a negative
impact on performance.

As with most new features lets make sure we have unit tests to support them.  In the PatientControllerWebTest add the
following code:

```java
    @Test
    public void test_PatientController_getPatients_Expect_OK() throws Exception {
        ResponseEntity<Patient[]> entity = restTemplate.getForEntity("/patients", Patient[].class);

        assertThat(entity.getStatusCode()).isEqualTo(HttpStatus.OK);

        assertThat(Arrays.asList(entity.getBody())).isNotNull()
                .extracting(Patient::getFamilyName)
                .contains("Spec", "Certify", "Neubus");
    }

    @Test
    public void test_PatientController_getPatientsWithPagination_Expect_PagedResult() throws Exception {
        ResponseEntity<Patient[]> entity =
                restTemplate.getForEntity("/patients?page={page}&size={size}", Patient[].class, 1, 1);

        assertThat(entity.getStatusCode()).isEqualTo(HttpStatus.OK);
        assertThat(entity.getHeaders().containsKey("X-Meta-Pagination")).isTrue();

        assertThat(Arrays.asList(entity.getBody())).isNotNull()
                .extracting(Patient::getFamilyName)
                .containsOnly("Certify");
    }

    @Test
    public void test_PatientController_getPatientsWithSortDesc_Expect_OrderedResult() throws Exception {
        ResponseEntity<Patient[]> entity =
                restTemplate.getForEntity("/patients?sort=familyName,desc", Patient[].class);

        assertThat(entity.getStatusCode()).isEqualTo(HttpStatus.OK);
        assertThat(entity.getHeaders().containsKey("X-Meta-Pagination")).isTrue();

        assertThat(Arrays.asList(entity.getBody())).isNotNull()
                .extracting(Patient::getFamilyName)
                .contains("Spec", "Neubus", "Certify");
    }
```

# Refactor Patient to use UUIDs as Primary Keys

After reading several articles and counter articles I decided to switch the Patient table to use a UUID instead of a
sequential Long.

The primary reasoning for this changes was to make it more difficult for someone to guess valid database IDs for
Patients if the system was somehow compromised.  Yes, we will add security around the REST calls and validate that the
user has the authority to see the Patient record, but in case there is a flaw or weakness accidentally introduced into
the system, this will make it quite a bit harder to just scrape the patient records just by guessing the next sequence
number.

The downside of this change is that storing each patient is a little more inefficient and takes more space.  Also,
depending on the actual database used UUIDs may not be stored as efficiently as possible and may have performance
problems at larger scales (> a couple million).  Many of these claims are several years old and database technologies
have improved in this area so it may be worth re-evaluating on a per database perspective.

On a side note, one could argue that a Patient should have some sort of generated universal Patient ID that is unique
and "human manageable" (meaning something one could relate on the phone) but we would need to derive some kind of
generation scheme that makes it reasonably difficult to guess what that ID would be.  Whatever this would look like
would likely have to be driven by government and standards bodies and is outside the scope of this exercise.
  
Even something like SSN as a natural key is somewhat suspect to me as it might give easy cross-system correlation of
data assuming the attacker is just using a secondary table lookup to harvest valid entries from this database.

In all this wasn't terribly difficult.  For the Patient entity we just convert the `@Id` field and the associated
getter methods:

```java
    @Id
    @GeneratedValue
    @Column(columnDefinition = "uuid", updatable = false)
    private UUID id;

    ...

    @JsonIgnore
    public UUID getId() {
        return id;
    }

    public String get_id() {
        return RESOURCE_PATH + "/" + id;
    }
```

Several test cases need to be reworked and the patients.csv needs to be updated to reflect the UUID instead of a number:

```csv
ID,BIRTH_DATE,GIVEN_NAME,FAMILY_NAME,ADDITIONAL_NAME,GENDER,EMAIL,HEIGHT,WEIGHT
e7a47ecd-4182-4209-911b-f7574ded1611,1972-05-05,Phillip,Spec,J,1,pjspec@junit.org,84,180
db890577-b31c-46d6-ae79-da965bcc8d5b,1973-06-06,Sally,Certify,T,2,,78,163
9b107a19-92c8-4242-8cdb-d8c07fd96b15,1962-02-15,Frank,Neubus,,0,,88,178
```

One other last thought is to combine the two ideas and still use a Long as Id and have a secondary indexed field for the
UUID field and only allow GETs on the UUID.  This could lessen the impact on databases that use clustered indexes (and
thus have issues with indexing randomized keys) by making it possible to periodically regenerate the index.  I still
suspect there may be performance issues with millions of rows however...

TODO: Need to rewrite this section and maybe earlier since I decided on combining the ideas (with the
UUID being just a unique secondary field).


# Add equals() and hashcode() in the Patient Entity

A lot of good information has already written about how and why to override the equals() and 
hashcode() methods for objects.  For objects that are used as part of an ORM solution, which our
@Entity classes are, we need to take additional care due to the nature of proxies.

- https://developer.jboss.org/wiki/EqualsandHashCode
- http://www.onjava.com/pub/a/onjava/2006/09/13/dont-let-hibernate-steal-your-identity.html
- https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5031614/the-jpa-hashcode-equals-dilemma
- https://vladmihalcea.com/2016/06/06/how-to-implement-equals-and-hashcode-using-the-jpa-entity-identifier/

Suffice it to say, defining object identity can be *really* hard to do correctly.  In our Patient
we now have a business key (patientId) that is a UUID.  This makes a good candidate for being used
in both equal and hashcode.

In Patient add the following code:

```java
  @Override
  public boolean equals(final Object o) {
    if (this == o) {
      return true;
    }
    if (!(o instanceof Patient)) {
      return false;
    }
    Patient patient = (Patient) o;
    return Objects.equals(getPatientId(), patient.getPatientId());
  }

  @Override
  public int hashCode() {
    return Objects.hash(getPatientId());
  }
```

The final question is do we really need to do this and the Hibernate docs say that you do *IF*
you intend to:

- Put instances of persistent classes in a Set (the recommended way to represent many-valued associations)
- Use reattachment of detached instances

We haven't done this yet so we are perhaps a bit premature in making this assumption but we'll
probably run into a need to do this when we get to mapping Doctor to Patient relationships.

# Refactor Paging Header Metadata with a Custom ResponseBodyAdvisor (and More)

Generally, we want to avoid a lot of boilerplate code and keep with the DRY principle.  I realized
that the paging metadata headers were going to be causing a lot of boilerplate.  I examined using
inheritance on Controllers and/or "Util" classes but decided on a feature of Spring MVC that lets
you create custom "advisors" that can intercept responses of specific types and shape them as
needed prior to the actual Jackson JSON marshalling.

Create a class called `PageResponseBodyAdvisor` with the code:

```java
@ControllerAdvice
public class PageResponseBodyAdvisor extends AbstractMappingJacksonResponseBodyAdvice {

  public static final String PAGE_METADATA_FMT = "page-number=%d,page-size=%d,total-elements=%d,total-pages=%d,first-page=%b,last-page=%b";

  @Override
  public boolean supports(MethodParameter returnType,
      Class<? extends HttpMessageConverter<?>> converterType) {
    return super.supports(returnType, converterType) &&
        Page.class.isAssignableFrom(returnType.getParameterType());
  }

  @Override
  protected void beforeBodyWriteInternal(MappingJacksonValue bodyContainer, MediaType contentType,
      MethodParameter returnType, ServerHttpRequest request, ServerHttpResponse response) {

    Page<?> page = ((Page<?>)bodyContainer.getValue());

    response.getHeaders().add("X-Meta-Pagination",
        String.format(PAGE_METADATA_FMT, page.getNumber(), page.getSize(), page.getTotalElements(),
            page.getTotalPages(), page.isFirst(), page.isLast()));

    // finally, strip out the actual content and replace it as the body value
    bodyContainer.setValue(page.getContent());
  }
}
```

This conveniently replaces the responses of type `Page<?>` by replacing the `MappingJacksonValue`
container with the actual response type (which is a Collection of things) and uses the Page wrapper
to create the custom Header metadata fields.

Now by refactoring the existing code to return the raw Page result from the find queries we no
longer have to worry about manually handling the specific pageable result.  We'll probably be able
to use this mechanism again later when we want to add more header metadata or shape the responses
in some way.

Additionally we can send back standard `Link` headers with path information for next, previous,
first, and last:

```java
  public static final String LINK_STANDARD_FMT = "<%s>; rel=\"%s\"";
  public static final String QUERY_PARAM_PAGE = "page";
  public static final String LINK_HEADER_FIRST = "first";
  public static final String LINK_HEADER_PREVIOUS = "prev";
  public static final String LINK_HEADER_NEXT = "next";
  public static final String LINK_HEADER_LAST = "last";
  
  private String getHttpHeaderLinksString(ServerHttpRequest request, Page<?> page) {
    List<String> headerLinks = new ArrayList<>();

    if (!page.isFirst()) {
      headerLinks.add(String.format(LINK_STANDARD_FMT, UriComponentsBuilder.fromHttpRequest(request)
          .replaceQueryParam(QUERY_PARAM_PAGE, 0)
          .build(), LINK_HEADER_FIRST));
    }

    if (page.hasPrevious()) {
      headerLinks.add(String.format(LINK_STANDARD_FMT, UriComponentsBuilder.fromHttpRequest(request)
              .replaceQueryParam(QUERY_PARAM_PAGE, page.previousPageable().getPageNumber())
              .build(), LINK_HEADER_PREVIOUS));
    }

    if (page.hasNext()) {
      headerLinks.add(String.format(LINK_STANDARD_FMT, UriComponentsBuilder.fromHttpRequest(request)
              .replaceQueryParam(QUERY_PARAM_PAGE, page.nextPageable().getPageNumber())
              .build(), LINK_HEADER_NEXT));
    }

    if (!page.isLast()) {
      headerLinks.add(String.format(LINK_STANDARD_FMT, UriComponentsBuilder.fromHttpRequest(request)
          .replaceQueryParam(QUERY_PARAM_PAGE, page.getTotalPages() - 1)
          .build(), LINK_HEADER_LAST));
    }

    return StringUtils.join(headerLinks, ", ");
  }
```

Call this method as part of the `beforeBodyWriteInternal` and add it the the http response headers
as a Link.  You can read more about Web Linking [here](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5988).

# Add finder with Query By Example

Spring Data recently added support for Query By Example.  Basically, QBE is a type of query that is
dynamically built based on a reference object.  Fields that are provided are used in the resulting
WHERE clause.  Typically, this can be rather limiting as many matches you want to use LIKE or greater
than/less than which is why the API also allows for a customizable "Example Matcher" where you can
add greater customization for specific fields.

By default, you don't have to do anything extra to have the QBE operations on your Repositories,
however, you'll probably want to implent them something like this:

```java
  @GetMapping("/queryByExample")
  public Page<Patient> getPatientsByExample(@RequestParam Map<String, Object> paramMap,
      @PageableDefault(size = DEFAULT_PAGE_SZ) Pageable pageable) {
    // naively copies map entries to matching properties in the Patient POJO
    Patient examplePatient = jacksonObjectMapper.convertValue(paramMap, Patient.class);

    Page<Patient> pagedResults = patientRepository
        .findAll(Example.of(examplePatient, DEFAULT_MATCHER), pageable);

    if (!pagedResults.hasContent()) {
      throw new NotFoundException("Resource %s/%s not found",
          Patient.RESOURCE_PATH, "/queryByExample");
    }

    return pagedResults;
  }
```

This is taking all passed in request parameters and putting them into a Map and then using a Jackson
utility method to copying them into a POJO of the type specified.  This creates the "example" object
that Spring Data uses in the query construction.  Only fields that are provided are mapped and the
Example.of only uses non-null values for matching.

In this case I'm also using a default matcher that is defined like this:

```java
  private static final ExampleMatcher DEFAULT_MATCHER = ExampleMatcher
      .matching()
      .withStringMatcher(CONTAINING)
      .withIgnoreCase();
```

This is telling Spring Data to construct an example query that matches on any String property as a
"contains" (i.e. LIKE %string%) and to ignore case.  This type of matching are frequent user
requirements for searches.

However, I discovered a slight side-effect from the UUID field that posed a problem.  Since the UUID
is set as part of the constructor, it has a non-null value and, because it is unique, it would cause
all queries to 404 and fail to return results.  Adding the "withIgnorePath" to the DEFAULT_MATCHER
seems to clear this up:

```java
      .withIgnorePaths("patientId")
```

Now, lets finish by writing a test.  In the PatientControllerWebTests add an additional test case:

```java
  @Test
  public void test_PatientController_getPatientsByExample_Expect_MatchingResult() throws Exception {
    ResponseEntity<Patient[]> responseEntity = restTemplate
        .getForEntity("/patients/queryByExample?birthDate={birthDate}", Patient[].class, "1962-02-15");

    assertThat(responseEntity.getStatusCode()).isEqualTo(HttpStatus.OK);
    assertThat(responseEntity.getHeaders().containsKey("X-Meta-Pagination")).isTrue();

    assertThat(Arrays.asList(responseEntity.getBody())).isNotNull()
        .extracting(Patient::getFamilyName)
        .first().isEqualTo("Neubus");
  }
```
